# 🌍 WalkFree
## The Class Project of the Practical Data Science Class ([MSc Data in Science](https://datascience.aueb.gr/)) of 2025/2026

 A student volunteering project combining AI, social awareness, and civic participation. From crowd-sourcing pavement images, to extracting (automatically) information (obstacles, pavement dimensions, etc), to using this information to suggest optimal city paths in the city (e.g., for people with walking difficulties, dynamic exit plan in case of a disaster, etc).

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

To create a **mobile app** that allows citizens to document and report issues on city pavements — such as **obstacles**, **unsafe surfaces**, or **accessibility violations** — while raising awareness about inclusive urban design. Students contribute by developing, testing, and improving the system, as well as engaging with the community.

---

## 💡 Motivation

Every day, people encounter blocked sidewalks, broken tiles, and cars parked on ramps — but most cases go unreported. This project empowers volunteers to:

* **Use technology for social good.**
* Help make the city more **accessible and safe** for everyone.
* Learn how **AI** can support citizen science and public participation.

## 👩‍💻 Student Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities | Skills Gained |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AI Developer** | Train or prompt models (LLMs/VLMs) to identify pavement issues from photos. | Prompt engineering, computer vision, transfer learning |
| **App Developer** | Build mobile interface for photo capture, issue tagging, and submission. | Frontend & UX design, mobile frameworks |
| **Data Scientist** | Collect, label, and analyze data on pavement issues. | Data cleaning, visualization, annotation design |
| **Community Liaison** | Coordinate with local citizens, disability groups, and municipalities. | Communication, civic engagement |
| **Project Manager** | Organize tasks, documentation, and reporting. | Leadership, agile teamwork |

## ⚙️ Core Workflow

The system is a **human-in-the-loop** reporting tool:

1.  Take a photo of a problematic pavement area.
2.  The app (using a Vision-Language Model) **suggests possible issues** (e.g., “car blocking ramp,” “cracked pavement”).
3.  The user selects the correct ones and **submits the report**.
4.  Reports appear on a **shared map** for visibility and potential city action.

## 🧠 Educational Value

This project provides:

* **Real-world AI for social good** application.
* Hands-on experience with **multimodal LLMs** (image + text).
* Exposure to human-in-the-loop system design.
* Collaboration between computer science, urban studies, and social engagement.

---

## 🏙️ Community Impact

* Create a **public map** of accessibility problems in the city.
* Provide **open data** for policymakers and NGOs.
* Raise **awareness** about inclusive public spaces.
* Foster a culture of student civic responsibility.
